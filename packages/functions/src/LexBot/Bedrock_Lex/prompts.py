#     1. **Title Extraction**: Derive a relevant and concise title that encapsulates the essence of the sonnet.
    
#     2. **Data Extraction for Chart Generation**:
#         - Identify key thematic elements, literary devices, or metrics pertinent to the sonnet.
#         - Organize the extracted data with unified column names (`x` for categories and `y` for corresponding values).
#         - Ensure that each data point is represented individually, especially when dealing with ranges or multiple related elements.
    
#     3. **Optimal Chart Type Recommendation**:
#         - Analyze the extracted data to determine the most suitable chart type (e.g., line chart, bar graph, scatter plot, pie chart) that effectively visualizes the information.
    
#     **Please adhere strictly to the JSON structure provided below. The number of rows may vary based on the data extracted, but ensure that all columns are aptly titled and relevant.**
