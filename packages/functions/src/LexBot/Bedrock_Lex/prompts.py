        GU: Emphasizes milestone-based assessments (e.g., graduation projects) mapped to PILOs; utilizes external panels to enhance alignment with outcomes.
        2. Moderation Processes

        BIBF: Internal moderation includes pre-assessment verification, post-assessment reviews, and double marking; external examiners provide feedback on assessments.
        GU: Internal assessments by supervisors and faculty, supported by external panel evaluations; focus on qualitative and quantitative feedback for continuous improvement.
        3. Graduation Projects and Capstone Components

        BIBF: No formal capstone project; incorporates project-based assessments and case studies throughout the curriculum.
        GU: Graduation project with structured supervision, progression tracking, and evaluation by supervisors, internal panels, and external experts.
        4. Academic Integrity Mechanisms

        BIBF: Policies include Turnitin for plagiarism detection, formal procedures for handling misconduct, and QA monitoring of academic integrity.
        GU: Graduation project progression form tracks student contributions, reducing risks of academic dishonesty; integrates broader academic integrity policies.
        5. Graduate Achievements and Employability

        BIBF: Graduate employability rate ranges from 85% to 92%; external moderation ensures alignment with industry needs.
        GU: Progression and graduation rates average between 80% and 90%; graduate achievements linked to structured project evaluations and alumni feedback.
